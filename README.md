## What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is a powerful open-source software library created by Google Brain team for numerical computations and building machine learning models. It is widely used by researchers, developers, and data scientists to design, train, and deploy artificial neural networks and other machine learning algorithms.

TensorFlow is designed to work with a wide range of programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, and can be deployed on various platforms, including desktop computers, servers, mobile devices, and even on the web.

## Why TensorFlow?
TensorFlow has proven to be effective in solving complex problems. Its pre-trained models and APIs make it easier to get started with machine learning and reduce the amount of time required for development.

Some of the popular applications of TensorFlow include:

- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Recommendation Algorithms
- Healthcare Diagnostic Tools
- Entertainment Analytics
- And much much more...
